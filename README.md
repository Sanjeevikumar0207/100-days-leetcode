🚀 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge

I’m taking the 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge to improve my problem-solving skills and Python programming.
The goal is to solve one problem per day and gradually increase the difficulty as I learn Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

🎯 Challenge Goals

✅ First 30 Days: Solve beginner-friendly problems (Easy) to build confidence.

🔜 From Day 31–Day 60: Solve Medium-level problems and start learning DSA topics.

🔝 From Day 61–Day 100: Solve harder problems and combine DSA knowledge.

💡 By the end of 100 days: Have a solid understanding of Python and DSA, with 100 solutions ready on GitHub as a portfolio.
| Day | Problem | Solution | Difficulty |
|-----|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | [Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/) | [Day01_RunningSum.py](Day01_RunningSum.py) | Easy |
| 2 | [Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/) | [Day02_MaximumWealth.py](Day02_MaximumWealth.py) | Easy |
| 3 | [Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/) | [Day03_LengthOfLastWord.py](Day03_LengthOfLastWord.py) | Easy |
| 4 | [Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/) | [Day04_NumberOfSteps.py](Day04_NumberOfSteps.py) | Easy |
